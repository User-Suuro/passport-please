Title
Passport Please: A Console-Based Passport Inspector Simulation - Inspired by Paper Please 

Description
Lore: Amid the war, the President ordered his men to open the country’s borders. It was indeed a foolish action, but his kind heart is always open to those who are in need, and no one will stop him because he is a dictator at the same time. In such a dire situation, the president ordered you as a passport inspector for incoming evacuating civilians, you were tasked with such heavy responsibility that one wrong action could endanger the whole country.

Objectives: As the Passport Inspector your main goal is to scan the passport information of incoming evacuating civilians. But beware of impostors that may deceive you, check each and every detail to ensure that the following information is valid. If you manage to correctly evacuate all the civilians and punish the impostors, you will guarantee the safety of your country.
a.	The goal of the player is to scan all information for each civilian, ensuring that there are no suspicious details.
b.	The player must approve at least 10 civilians, or else you will incur the president’s wrath.
c.	Suspicious details could include:
-	Name of a wanted criminal
-	Unrealistic Age
-	Expired passport
-	Shady occupation 
d.	To ensure that the game does not end abruptly, the player have two (2) chances to approve a civilian with invalid passport and also two (2) chances to reject a civilian with a valid passport, but more than that will lead to the demise of your country.
e.	If the player allows suspicious civilians to pass three (3) times, then the country will be in danger, thus game over.
f.	If the player turned down a civilian with valid passport three (3) times, then you will be fired from your job, thus game over.
